# Private-Projects
Collection of Side Projects, seperated into specific language folders

When did I start to learn:

Python3 -> Started May 2018

Java8 -> Started August 2018

C++ -> Started November 2018

Each language is organized by project start year, to show complexity of initial project ideas over time inside each specific language.  I might attempt to do more language crosscoding like I'm doing with Sudoku, but it isn't likely, given the need to work on creating new logic and not just focus on syntax conversion.
